    <p class="p">HTML and CSS are two essential components of web development. HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup
        Language, is used to structure the content of a webpage. It provides a set of tags that define the different
        elements on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS, which stands for Cascading Style
        Sheets, is used to control the presentation and layout of a webpage. It allows developers to define the colors,
        fonts, sizes, and positioning of elements on a webpage. Both HTML and CSS are crucial for creating visually
        appealing and user-friendly websites.

        The utilization of color in CSS and JavaScript is a significant aspect of web development. Both languages offer
        various methods and properties to manipulate and control color in web pages. CSS provides a wide range of color
        options through its color property, allowing developers to specify colors using various formats such as
        hexadecimal, RGB, and named colors. Additionally, CSS offers the ability to apply color to different elements,
        including text, backgrounds, borders, and more.

        JavaScript, on the other hand, enables dynamic manipulation of color through its Document Object Model (DOM)
        manipulation capabilities. Developers can use JavaScript to change the color of elements in response to user
        interactions or other events. This can be achieved by accessing and modifying the CSS properties of elements
        using JavaScript methods and functions.

        In conclusion, the use of color in CSS and JavaScript plays a crucial role in web development, allowing
        developers to create visually appealing and interactive web pages.
